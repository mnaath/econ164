    Reforms could include the introduction of surveys or censuses to prevent the overstocking of food.\\

    Benefits include increased food security.
    Costs include fiscal deficit, the encouragement of inefficient producers, and the distortion of cropping patters. 
    Reforms could include a tiered system which allocated more fertilizers to higher productivity farmers whilst punishing the less productive ones.\\
